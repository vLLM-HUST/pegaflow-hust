"""Build script for the _npu_ipc C extension.

This setup.py is used both for standalone builds (e.g., `pip install -e .` when
developing locally) and as a reference for packaging integrations.  When the
library is distributed via `pegaflow-llm`, the build is orchestrated by
`pyproject.toml` / `setup.py` at the project root.

Standalone build:
    cd python/pegaflow/npu_ipc_bindings && python setup.py build_ext --inplace
