//! Instance and GPU context management for PegaFlow.
//!
//! This module provides the hierarchical context structure for managing
//! multi-tenant inference instances and their associated GPU resources.
//!
//! An instance goes through two phases:
//!
//! 1. **Registering** — workers attach their GPUs one by one, each declaring
//!    the KV cache layers that actually exist on that device. The engine makes
//!    no assumption about the model's layer count.
//! 2. **Sealed** — when the last of `world_size` workers has registered, the
//!    union of all declared layer names is sorted into a dense layer-id space
//!    and the slot topology is validated. Save/load/query are only possible on
//!    a sealed instance.
//!
//! Deriving the id space from what workers actually register (instead of a
//! connector-side guess from model config) is what makes optional speculative
//! MTP layers, external drafters, and hybrid attention layouts work without
//! special cases: the layer set *is* the topology.
